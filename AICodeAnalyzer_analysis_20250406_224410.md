*   **`DeepSeek.SendPromptWithModelAsync` Implementation (Major):**  The original implementation of `SendPromptWithModelAsync` in the `DeepSeek` class throws a `NotImplementedException()`. This is a critical bug and should be fixed ASAP. The updated implementation has a complex logic for handling `DeepSeekReasoner` model, including role alternation. Ensure this complex logic is thoroughly tested to prevent unexpected behaviors.

*   **Potential Threading Issues in `MainWindow.ProcessSelectedFiles`:** The original code reads files synchronously inside a `Task.Run`, which blocks the thread pool thread.  The newer version attempts to fix this, but still has a risk of race conditions.

*   **`CodePrompt.GetHashCode` (Minor):** The `GetHashCode()` method in `CodePrompt` always returns 0.  This disables the benefits of using a hash code in dictionaries and hash sets, and it is explicitly noted that it may lead to unexpected behaviour.  Ideally, this should return a hash code based on the `Name` property, but this requires careful consideration of immutability.

*   **Error Handling in `ApiKeyManager.SaveKeys` and `ApiKeyManager.LoadKeys`, `RecentFilesManager.SaveRecentFiles` and `RecentFilesManager.LoadRecentFiles` (Minor):**  These methods silently fail on exceptions during loading or saving. This can lead to unexpected behavior and makes debugging difficult.

*   **Inconsistent Error Handling:**  The codebase uses both `ErrorLogger.LogError` (which shows a `MessageBox`) and `ErrorLogger.LogErrorSilently`. There's no clear pattern for when to use each. It would be better to have a consistent error handling strategy.

*   **Unnecessary Checks in `ApiKeyManager.SaveKey`:** The check `// KeyStorage is now guaranteed to be non-null so we can remove this check` is in a comment. Either remove the check or remove the comment and keep the check.

*   **Command Injection in `FileAssociationManager.RegisterApplication`:**  The `RegisterApplication` method constructs a command string that includes the executable path.  If the executable path contains special characters or spaces that are not properly escaped, it could potentially lead to command injection.  While unlikely in this specific scenario (since you control the executable path), it's a good practice to always escape command-line arguments.

*   **Dependency Injection:**  Consider using a dependency injection framework (e.g., Autofac, Ninject, Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection) to manage dependencies between classes.  This will make the code more testable and easier to maintain.

*   **Asynchronous Programming Best Practices:** Ensure proper error handling within `async` methods. Avoid swallowing exceptions. Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` when awaiting tasks to prevent deadlocks.

*   **Code Duplication:**  There are several places where code is duplicated (e.g., populating the model dropdown, handling errors in API calls).  Refactor the code to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

*   **Magic Strings:**  Replace magic strings (e.g., "Claude API", "gpt-4") with constants or enums to improve readability and reduce the risk of errors.

*   **More Granular Locking:**  In `MainWindow`, the `_filesByExtension` is locked for the entire batch. Consider finer grained locking if it makes sense.

*   **Better Logging:**  While there's a logging mechanism, it's basic.  Consider using a more robust logging framework (e.g., NLog, Serilog) that allows for different log levels, targets, and formatting.

*   **Consider Using HttpClientFactory:** Instead of instantiating `HttpClient` directly with `new HttpClient()`, use `HttpClientFactory` for better resource management.

*   **String Interpolation:** Use string interpolation ($"") instead of `string.Format()` in newer C# code.

1.  **Fix `DeepSeek.SendPromptWithModelAsync` (Critical):** Implement the `SendPromptWithModelAsync` method in the `DeepSeek` class or remove it from the factory.

3.  **Address Threading Issues in `MainWindow.ProcessSelectedFiles` (High):** Ensure that file I/O is truly asynchronous and that there are no race conditions when updating the UI.

4.  **Improve Error Handling (Medium):**  Implement a consistent error handling strategy and avoid silently failing in `ApiKeyManager.SaveKeys`, `ApiKeyManager.LoadKeys`, `RecentFilesManager.SaveRecentFiles` and `RecentFilesManager.LoadRecentFiles`.

5.  **Fix `CodePrompt.GetHashCode` (Low):** Provide a correct implementation for `GetHashCode`, or remove the IEquatable implementation to avoid unintended consequences.
